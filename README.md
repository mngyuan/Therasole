Therasole
===
A smart insole that tracks plantar pressure and steps taken, for later review by patients with their doctors and physicians to help with physical therapy for people recovering from say, knee surgery, or suffering from loss of feeling in extremities because of diabetes.

See the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xigE_cjDBU8).

This project uses meteor. The meteor server hosts a webapp and also connects with BLE to the Therasole.

Because of use of the npm package `noble` I can [no longer deploy](https://github.com/meteorhacks/npm/issues/40)  to http://therasole.meteor.com/). Currently working on deploying to http://fitsole.herokuapp.com/.
